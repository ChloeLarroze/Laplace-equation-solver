# Laplace-equation-solver

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the solution to the Laplace equation in two dimensions using an iterative numerical method. The notebook covers the discretization of the Laplace equation and includes the code to solve it, as well as a detailed explanation of the mathematical proof using Taylor expansions.

This project was completed during my second year of **Prépa**, which is an intensive two-year preparatory course in France for students aiming to enter engineering schools. It focuses on advanced mathematics, physics, and other sciences.
